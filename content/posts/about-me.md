I suppose anybody who reads this might want to know a little about the person writing. The first place to start would be my name, which if you haven't guessed it by now - is Chance. I've been interested in science and programming for about 15 years now, even went so far as to get a bachelor's in physics and mathematics, a master's in physics, and the workings of a Ph.D. in the same (which I left for reasons). I have been a professional software developer/data engineer for about 5 years now, mainly focusing on healthcare, except for my latest foray into satellite operations. I love learning about and attempting to solve novel problems, and I hope to bring that process to light here on this blog. Make no mistake, this blog is mainly for my benefit, but if I can help somebody along the way, I'd call that a net positive outcome.
